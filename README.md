# Project Description - Using Reqres.in API

This project demonstrates the use of the RESTful API provided by the Reqres.in platform for testing and prototyping. The source codes included in this repository exemplify HTTP requests of types GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, which are essential for data manipulation in a web application. The main goal of this project is to learn and test interactions with a RESTful API in a controlled environment.

## GET Requests
GET requests were used to retrieve information about users and other available resources. These requests are useful for understanding the structure of JSON responses and testing data handling.

## POST Requests
POST requests were made to create new users and resources. These requests help test the functionality of adding data and verify the integrity of the data sent to the server.

## PUT Requests
PUT requests were used to update existing user information. Through these requests, we could test the data update functionality and ensure that changes are correctly implemented.

## DELETE Requests
DELETE requests were used to remove users or resources. These requests are essential for testing the application's ability to correctly handle data deletion.

Conclusions
The project demonstrated the efficiency and ease of use of the Reqres.in API for testing and development. Through these requests, we were able to learn and test various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a simple and effective manner. The Reqres.in API proves to be a valuable tool for developers who want to experiment and better understand interactions with a RESTful API without needing their own backend in the initial development stages.
